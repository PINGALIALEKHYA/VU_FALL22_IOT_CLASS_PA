During class hours I have builded anjay client for my ESP32. Please find the below screenshot

Later I have done experiments on light control and push button with the help of Freenove C_Tutorial. Here are the steps to do light control experiment. I 
1.	Open the menu config as we have done during building of anjay client.
2.	Need to navigate to component  config.
3.	Select anjay-esp32-client.
4.	Select light control and is enabled.
5.	Need to navigate to light control options, enable the red light and entered the port number.
6.	Later I have saved and started building, flashing.
7.	I can able to see light control in the leshan server. I have experimented by switching OFF/ON and increase/ decrease the light intensity by using dimmer.
8.	Here are some of the screenshots and videos.
Problem Faced: I have used the blue color light instead of red in the first but I unable to get the results as expected. Later I have used the red color in which I Can able to see the results.

Please find the screenshot for circuit diagram for light control.
