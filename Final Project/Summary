As security is a crucial and critical issue in a home environment. My Project was to provide security and alert the owner of the building if any intrusion detects. I have also used LED along with buzzer in case if the person can’t hear he can identify by using LED. It also send the alert notification to the owner as Intruder detected.
I have used PIR motion sensor in the ESP32 to detect the intrusion .I Have used Ardunio to connect to Mqtt. Data is sent to the node red (Mqtt Client) via mosquitto (Mqtt Broker). Then the data is sent into the database for further verification. Reply is sent back to Esp32 via mqtt broker with in response LED and Buzzer will turn on. Along with that I have sent the message to the owner of the building.
Sensor ( ESP32 -> mqtt)  Controller (mqtt ESP32)
